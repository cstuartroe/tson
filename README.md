# TSON (TypeScript Object Notation)

TSON is a superset of JSON that introduces several features:

 * Static typing, with a type system based on TypeScript
 * TypeScript-based syntax for imports, exports, and declaring variables and types
 * Comments
 * Quote-less object keys
 * Multiline strings
 * JSX

The TSON library can also be used to statically analyze the schema of JSON.
